        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>Hey there! My name is Jessa and I have been working through the <a target="_blank"
                href="https://threejs-journey.com/">three.js journey</a> taught by Bruno
            Simon (he's a wonderful teacher). I hope it inspires you to get
            creative!
        </p>
        <p>Take some time to interact with this page. As you scroll down the page, you will notice the 3D object reacting by spinning a little faster. They also react to your mouse
            movements. You can also use the controls at the top to change the metalness and roughness of the objects.
            Have fun!</p>
        <p>For this project, I combined what I learned from the "Materials" and "Scroll Based Animation" lessons. I used
            an environment map
            for the 3D objects. The image used for the environment map was provided by Bruno Simons. It came from <a
                href="https://hdrihaven.com/">HDRIHaven</a>, which is a great resource providing free images under <a
                href="https://hdrihaven.com/p/license.php">CC0 license</a>.</p>
        <p>Thank you for stopping by :)</p>
